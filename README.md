# Style-Transfer
Style Transfer and Fast Style Transfer

## To run
Run the ipython notebook -> provide style image and content image.


-------------------------------
## Notes
The Style transfer - using optimization is working.
I could not get the Fast style transfer to work - Initial dataset used -> COCO training 2014 - 80k training images. Used an existing implementation to generate pastiches for comparison using the VOC Pascal dataset.


## References:
I have taken references from a couple of other implementations,
1) Keras official implementation of style transfer :
